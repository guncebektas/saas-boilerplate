## Introduction
We are using latest version of Meteor.js with MongoDB, Redis, Bull Mq, React, Tailwind and FlowBite UI.
There are small differences on our approach to Meteor.js. However, learning Meteor.js from its own guide will be
enough to contribute.

## Why Meteor.js?
Meteor.js is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications.
If you are new to Meteor.js, you will be amazed by its capabilities and ease of use.

Adding only one line of code can scale your application and you can see 200+ concurrent users on your app without any problem.
The metal power that you will need for it is 2 CPU and 1 GB RAM. You can see the performance of the app on the <a href="https://saas-boilerplate.meteorapp.com/">demo</a> link.

It provides a seamless development experience with the following benefits:

### Real-time Data: 
Meteor.js allows for real-time data updates, making it ideal for applications that require live data synchronization.

### Full-Stack Solution
It offers an integrated solution with a single language (JavaScript) for both client and server-side code, simplifying development and maintenance. 

### Rich Ecosystem
Meteor.js has a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries, including support for MongoDB, making it easy to extend and enhance your application.

### Rapid Development
With features like hot code push and built-in support for popular front-end frameworks like React, Meteor.js enables rapid development and iteration. 

### Scalability & Performance Monitoring
Meteor.js can be scaled efficiently with the help of technologies like Redis and Bull Mq, ensuring your application can handle increased load and traffic. 
In addition to this, Meteor.js provides performance monitoring tools to help you optimize your application.

### Community and Support
A strong community and extensive documentation provide ample support and resources for developers working with Meteor.js.
